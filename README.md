## Installation

The code is built in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (should work fine under Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as well).

### Pre-requisite

* OpenCV 3.4.2 (with calib3d).
* ffmpeg (`sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`).
* cmake.

### Build

* Clone the repo and go to the cloned repo.

* Build the code
```
cmake .
make
```

* Run the code with provided sample images
```
./RUN_fisheye.sh
```

Please be informed that the code doesn't include the temporal coherence control, but one can implement it using the description in [1].

### Youtube 360-Video

The output video can be uploaded to youtube as 360 degree view.
Spatial media metadata needs to be added to the output file ([more..](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en
))

* Tool: [Google Spatial media metadata tool](https://github.com/google/spatial-media.git)

Usage:
```
python spatialmedia -i stitched_pano_360_0546_SRA.mp4 stitched_pano_360_0546_SRA_youtube.mp4
```

## Performance

It takes around 70ms-90ms* to stitch one 3840x1920 image (02 x fisheye images captured by Samsung Gear 360 C200) on a laptop with an Intel i7-8750H CPU + 32GB Memory. See [clip](https://youtu.be/GtZF6EKe50U). `(*)` recorded when CPU performance is set to [75%](https://github.com/drNoob13/batteryimprove).
