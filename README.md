## Update
[v2.1]: Update parser class. Update compiler requirement to C++17.

[v2.0]: Code restructuring.

[v1.2]: Stitch video instead of stitch frame. Drop dependency on ffmpeg.

[v1.1]: Remove dependencies on `utils/mask_1920x1920_fovd_187.jpg` and `utils/post_find.yml`. Use `binary_mask` and `blend_post` generated in the init() process instead. This is for the request to test the code with different image resolution than 3840x1920 native of Gear360-C200.

## Installation

The code is built and tested in Ubuntu 16.04 and Ubuntu 18.04.

### Pre-requisite

* C++17-support compiler. If your compiler doesn't fully support C++17, you can force g++7 (Linux) by adding the following line in CMakeList.txt:
```
if(COMPILER_SUPPORTS_CXX17)
    set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER  "/usr/bin/g++-7")  # only if necessary (Ubuntu 16.04 or older)
```
* CMake 3.5.1.
* OpenCV 3.4.2 (with calib3d) or more recent version of OpenCV.

### Build

* Clone the repo and go to the cloned repo.

* Build the code 
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd ..
    ```

* Run the example 
    ```
    cd scripts
    ./RUN_fisheye.sh

    ```

Please be informed that the code doesn't include the temporal coherence control, but one can implement it using the description in [1].

### Youtube 360-Video

The output video can be uploaded to youtube as 360 degree view.
Spatial media metadata needs to be added to the output file ([more..](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6178631?hl=en
))

* Tool: [Google Spatial media metadata tool](https://github.com/google/spatial-media.git)

Usage:
```
python spatialmedia -i stitched_pano_360_0546_SRA.mp4 stitched_pano_360_0546_SRA_youtube.mp4
```

## Performance

It takes around 70ms-90ms* to stitch one 3840x1920 image (02 x fisheye images captured by Samsung Gear 360 C200) on a laptop with an Intel i7-8750H CPU + 32GB Memory. See [clip](https://youtu.be/GtZF6EKe50U). `(*)` recorded when CPU performance is set to [75%](https://github.com/drNoob13/batteryimprove).
